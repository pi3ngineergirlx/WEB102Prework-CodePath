## Notes

The backtick syntax for writing strings was initially misleading, as I am used to using quotation marks to write text in strings.
It took me some time to realize that backticks allow variables to be implemented into strings and for messages to be personalized. Additionally, displaying the top and runner up games in terms of funding did not occur even if the code appears correct.
